# MAAS MCP Server Improvement Plan

## Overview

The MAAS MCP Server is a bridge between the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Canonical's Metal as a Service (MAAS) API. It allows AI models and MCP-compliant clients to interact with MAAS infrastructure through standardized tools and resources. This PRD outlines the improvements needed to enhance the server's functionality, reliability, and maintainability.

## Current State

The server currently implements the core functionality required to interact with the MAAS API, including:
- MCP v2024-11-05 compliant server
- OAuth 1.0a authentication with MAAS API
- Tools for common MAAS operations
- Resources for accessing MAAS data
- Progress notification system for long-running operations
- Operations registry for tracking and managing operations
- Caching system for frequently accessed resources
- Audit logging for resource access and modifications

However, several issues have been identified that need to be addressed:
- Test failures in the progress notification system
- TypeScript configuration inconsistencies
- Error handling improvements needed
- Documentation gaps
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Core Features to Improve

### 1. Test Framework Enhancement

**What it does**: Ensures the reliability and correctness of the codebase through comprehensive testing.

**Why it's important**: A robust test framework is essential for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.

**How it works**: The test framework uses Jest to run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Tests verify that components work correctly in isolation and together.

**Improvements needed**:
- Fix issues with `deployMachineWithProgress.test.ts` and `commissionMachineWithProgress.test.ts`
- Update test timeouts to account for asynchronous operations
- Improve mock implementations to better simulate the MAAS API
- Add more comprehensive test coverage for error scenarios

### 2. Error Handling System

**What it does**: Provides standardized error handling and reporting across the application.

**Why it's important**: Proper error handling improves debugging, user experience, and system reliability.

**How it works**: The error handling system catches errors at various levels, formats them consistently, and provides appropriate responses to clients.

**Improvements needed**:
- Standardize error responses across all tools and resources
- Add more detailed error information to help with debugging
- Improve error logging with more context
- Ensure all errors are properly logged with appropriate severity levels

### 3. Progress Notification System

**What it does**: Provides real-time updates for long-running operations like machine deployment and commissioning.

**Why it's important**: Progress notifications keep clients informed about operation status, improving user experience.

**How it works**: The system sends notifications with progress percentage and status messages as operations progress.

**Improvements needed**:
- Enhance rate limiting with more sophisticated strategies
- Add more granular progress updates for long-running operations
- Provide more detailed status messages
- Improve error reporting in notifications

### 4. Caching System

**What it does**: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed resources.

**Why it's important**: Caching reduces load on the MAAS API and improves response times for clients.

**How it works**: The system caches responses from the MAAS API based on configurable TTL values and invalidation strategies.

**Improvements needed**:
- Optimize cache TTL values based on resource update frequency
- Implement more sophisticated cache invalidation strategies
- Add cache monitoring for hit/miss rates
- Implement cache size monitoring to prevent memory issues

### 5. Documentation

**What it does**: Provides information about the server's functionality, API, and usage.

**Why it's important**: Good documentation is essential for users and developers to understand and use the server effectively.

**How it works**: Documentation is provided in Markdown files in the docs directory, covering various aspects of the server.

**Improvements needed**:
- Ensure all tools and resources are properly documented
- Add more examples and use cases
- Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Add more detailed error descriptions and solutions

### Data Models

No changes to data models are required, but validation and error handling should be improved.

### APIs and Integrations

The server will continue to use the MAAS API v2.0 and MCP v2024-11-05, but with improved error handling and performance.

### Infrastructure Requirements

No changes to infrastructure requirements are needed.
