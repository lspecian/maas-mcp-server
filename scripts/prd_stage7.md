# PRD - Stage 7: Final Review, Documentation & Future Enhancements Planning

## Original PRD Reference:
Based on "Report: Building an MCP Server for Canonical MAAS API in TypeScript (MCP v2024-11-05)" ([`scripts/prd.txt`](scripts/prd.txt))

## Stage Focus:
Finalizing all project documentation (e.g., README, comments, JSDoc for tools/resources), conducting a comprehensive review of the entire implementation against all staged PRDs and the original PRD, validating full conformance with the MCP 2024-11-05 specification, and outlining potential future enhancements for the MCP-MAAS server.

## Relevant Sections from Original PRD ([`scripts/prd.txt`](scripts/prd.txt)):

### 10. Conclusion and Future Enhancements

#### Recap:
This report has detailed the design and implementation strategy for an MCP server that acts as a bridge to the Canonical MAAS API, using TypeScript and the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. The server exposes MAAS functionalities as MCP Tools and MAAS data as MCP Resources, adhering to the MCP 2024-11-05 specification.

#### Key Achievements (to be verified at this stage):
The outlined approach addresses critical aspects including:
*   Secure authentication with the MAAS API using OAuth 1.0a PLAINTEXT.
*   Correct handling of `multipart/form-data` requests required by MAAS.
*   Mapping MAAS API operations and data structures to MCP primitives.
*   A strategy for providing progress notifications for long-running MAAS tasks.

#### Future Enhancements (to be planned/documented):
The current design provides a solid foundation. Several enhancements could further improve its utility and completeness:
*   **MCP Prompts:** Define and implement MCP Prompts for common or complex MAAS workflows (e.g., "Guide me through deploying a new server with specific tags and network settings"). This would leverage the `server.prompt()` functionality of the SDK.
*   **Resource Subscriptions:** For MAAS data that might change frequently (e.g., machine statuses, available IP addresses), implement MCP resource subscriptions. This would involve using `resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe` methods and sending `notifications/resourceChanged`. Implementing this for MAAS would likely require the MCP server to become stateful and to incorporate background polling or event listening mechanisms.
*   **Broader MAAS API Coverage:** Systematically implement MCP Tools and Resources for a more comprehensive set of MAAS API endpoints.
*   **Advanced Error Reporting and Logging:** Utilize MCP's defined error reporting utilities more deeply and enhance structured logging with more contextual information.
*   **Server-Side Caching:** Given potential MAAS API performance issues, implementing a caching layer within the MCP server for frequently accessed, slowly changing MAAS data could improve response times.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Implement an authorization layer for the MCP server itself (e.g., API key auth for MCP clients).

## Activities for Stage 7:

### 1. Documentation Finalization:
*   **README.md:** Create or update the main project `README.md` file. It should include:
    *   Project overview and purpose.
    *   Prerequisites (Node.js version, MAAS API access).
    *   Setup and installation instructions (cloning, `npm install`).
    *   Configuration (environment variables: `MAAS_API_URL`, `MAAS_API_KEY`, `MCP_PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL`).
    *   How to run the server (`npm start`, `npm run dev`).
    *   How to run tests (`npm test`).
    *   Overview of available MCP Tools and Resources (perhaps linking to more detailed docs or auto-generated docs).
    *   Brief explanation of the project structure.
*   **Code Comments & JSDoc:**
    *   Ensure all functions, classes, methods, and complex logic blocks have clear, concise comments.
    *   Add JSDoc/TSDoc comments to all exported functions, classes, MCP tool handlers, and resource handlers. This is especially important for describing the purpose, parameters, and return values of MCP tools and resources, as this information can be used by LLMs or client developers.
    *   Zod schemas should already have `.describe()` calls for parameters and the overall schema, which serve as a form of documentation.
*   **API Documentation (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Consider generating more formal documentation for the MCP Tools and Resources offered by the server. This could be a separate Markdown file or potentially auto-generated from JSDoc/Zod schemas if a suitable tool is found.

### 2. Comprehensive Code Review:
*   Conduct a full pass review of the entire codebase ([`src/`](src/)).
*   Check for consistency in coding style, naming conventions, and error handling.
*   Verify adherence to the architectural decisions made in earlier stages.
*   Look for any remaining TODOs, FIXMEs, or potential bugs.
*   Ensure all dependencies are necessary and up-to-date (within reason for stability).

### 3. Validation Against All PRDs and MCP Specification:
*   Review the implementation against each staged PRD ([`scripts/prd_stage1.md`](scripts/prd_stage1.md) through [`scripts/prd_stage6.md`](scripts/prd_stage6.md)) to ensure all requirements and sanity/auditing points for each stage have been met.
*   Re-validate against the original PRD ([`scripts/prd.txt`](scripts/prd.txt)) for overall project goals.
*   Double-check that all MCP messages (tool calls/results, resource requests/results, notifications) strictly conform to the MCP 2024-11-05 schema as defined in the specification and the SDK's type definitions. Use MCP Inspector for this if possible.

### 4. Final Testing Pass:
*   Re-run all unit and integration tests to ensure no regressions have been introduced.
*   Perform a final round of manual testing using MCP Inspector, covering key use cases for all implemented tools and resources, including error paths and long-running operations.

### 5. Future Enhancements Document:
*   Create a document (e.g., [`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md)) detailing the potential future enhancements identified in Section 10 of the original PRD and any others identified during development.
*   For each enhancement, briefly describe its purpose, potential benefits, and high-level implementation considerations. This will serve as a roadmap for future development iterations.

## Sanity Checks for Stage 7:
*   All planned documentation (README, code comments) is complete and accurate.
*   The codebase has undergone a final review.
*   The implementation successfully meets the requirements of all staged PRDs and the original PRD.
*   The server's MCP communication is fully compliant with the 2024-11-05 specification.
*   All tests pass.
*   A document outlining future enhancements is created.

## Auditing Points for Stage 7:
*   Review `README.md` for clarity, completeness, and accuracy of instructions.
*   Spot-check code comments and JSDoc in key modules ([`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts:1), [`src/maas/MaasApiClient.ts`](src/maas/MaasApiClient.ts:1), example tool/resource handlers).
*   Confirm that a final validation against the MCP specification has been performed (e.g., by reviewing test outputs or MCP Inspector logs).
*   Review the [`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`](FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md) document for clarity and completeness.
*   Obtain final sign-off or approval if this is part of a larger team process.
