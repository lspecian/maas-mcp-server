package service

// This file might become empty or be removed if all MachineService methods are consolidated elsewhere.
// For now, we'll leave it with just the package declaration and imports if any are needed by other files in this package.
// Since DiscoverMachines was the only function here, and it's being removed (assuming it's consolidated in machine.go),
// this file might only contain the package declaration or be removed if no other service types are defined here.
// For now, let's keep the package declaration.
// Imports are removed as they are no longer used by any function in this file.
