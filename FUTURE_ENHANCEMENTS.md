# Future Enhancements for MAAS MCP Server

## Introduction

### Purpose of this Document

This document outlines potential improvements and extensions to the MAAS MCP Server based on the original Product Requirements Document (PRD) and insights gained during development. It serves as a roadmap for future development efforts, providing a structured approach to enhancing the server's functionality, performance, and security.

### Current State of the Project

The MAAS MCP Server is a TypeScript implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a bridge to the Canonical MAAS API. The server exposes MAAS functionalities as MCP Tools and MAAS data as MCP Resources, allowing AI models and MCP-compliant clients to interact with MAAS in a standardized manner.

The current implementation includes:
- Secure authentication with the MAAS API using OAuth 1.0a PLAINTEXT
- Handling of multipart/form-data requests required by MAAS
- Mapping of MAAS API operations and data structures to MCP primitives
- Progress notifications for long-running MAAS tasks
- Structured logging and error handling
- Caching system for frequently accessed resources
- Comprehensive testing framework

### How to Use this Document

This document should be used as:
1. A planning tool for prioritizing future development efforts
2. A reference for understanding the potential growth areas of the MAAS MCP Server
3. A guide for developers working on extending the server's functionality
4. A basis for creating specific implementation tasks and milestones

Each enhancement includes a description, implementation considerations, technical approach, and estimated effort level to help with planning and prioritization.

## Planned Enhancements

### MCP Prompts for Common MAAS Workflows

#### Description
Implement MCP Prompts for common or complex MAAS workflows, leveraging the `server.prompt()` functionality of the MCP SDK. This would provide guided experiences for operations like deploying a new server with specific tags and network settings.

#### Implementation Considerations
- The MCP specification includes support for prompts as reusable, templated messages or workflows
- Prompts can guide the LLM's interaction with the server in a structured manner
- Implementation requires defining prompt templates and handlers

#### Example Prompt Scenarios
1. **Guided Server Deployment**:
   - Step-by-step workflow for selecting a machine, configuring network settings, choosing an OS, and deploying
   - Includes validation at each step and suggestions based on available resources

2. **Network Configuration Wizard**:
   - Guided process for setting up subnets, VLANs, and IP ranges
   - Validation of network settings and suggestions for optimal configurations

3. **Machine Commissioning and Testing**:
   - Workflow for commissioning new machines and running hardware tests
   - Analysis of test results and recommendations for hardware issues

4. **Tag-based Machine Management**:
   - Creating and applying tags to groups of machines
   - Setting up tag-based automation rules

#### Technical Approach
1. Define a prompt schema using Zod for each workflow
2. Implement prompt handlers that process user inputs and guide the next steps
3. Create a prompt registry to manage available prompts
4. Develop a mechanism to track prompt state across interactions
5. Integrate with existing MCP tools and resources

#### Estimated Effort: Medium-High

### Resource Subscriptions

#### Description
Implement MCP resource subscriptions for MAAS data that might change frequently (e.g., machine statuses, available IP addresses). This would involve using `resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe` methods and sending `notifications/resourceChanged` to provide real-time updates to clients.

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Server State Management**:
   - Make the MCP server stateful to track active subscriptions
   - Implement subscription storage with client identification
   - Create cleanup mechanisms for expired subscriptions

2. **Subscription API Implementation**:
   - Implement the `resources/subscribe` method to register client interest in specific resources
   - Implement the `resources/unsubscribe` method to remove subscriptions
   - Define subscription parameters (resource URI patterns, filtering options)

3. **Change Detection Mechanisms**:
   - Implement background polling of MAAS API for resource changes
   - Define change detection logic for different resource types
   - Optimize polling intervals based on resource update frequency

4. **Notification Delivery**:
   - Implement the `notifications/resourceChanged` method to notify clients of changes
   - Include resource URI, change type, and updated data in notifications
   - Add rate limiting to prevent notification storms

#### Considerations for Making the Server Stateful
- Subscription data must be stored in memory or a persistent store
- Client sessions must be tracked and managed
- Server must handle client disconnections gracefully
- Scaling considerations for multiple server instances

#### Options for Background Polling or Event Listening
1. **Polling Strategy**:
   - Implement adaptive polling intervals based on resource type and update frequency
   - Use a worker pool to distribute polling load
   - Implement backoff strategies for error handling

2. **Webhook Integration** (if supported by MAAS):
   - Register webhooks with MAAS for event notifications
   - Process incoming webhooks and map to subscribed resources
   - Maintain webhook registrations

3. **WebSocket Connection** (if supported by MAAS):
   - Establish persistent WebSocket connections to MAAS
   - Process real-time events from MAAS
   - Handle connection failures and reconnection

#### Estimated Effort: High
